##Description
Application Candidate Tracker dynamically assigns compatibility scores to adoption candidates; generates tables for users and applicants; imports and exports csv; and automates vetting process for pet adoption.
##Reason
Manual application processes are lengthy and subject to time delays. The ability to automate the background process allows NPO volunteers and directors to devote more time to animal rescue without sacrificing on application standards. Furthermore, the user interface allows administrators and NPO users to easily access, download, and import data regarding applicant scores and home situations. Overall, Application Candidate Tracker optimizes the application process: thereby, increasing the impact of Saving One Life.
